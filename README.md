# Nexlify – Bootstrap 5 Internship Task

### How I Built This (Step-by-Step)

1. **Setup**: Created `index.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html` with Bootstrap 5 CDN.
2. **Component Exploration**: Studied [Bootstrap Examples](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/) → extracted **Navbar, Cards, Forms, Hero, Grid**.
3. **Design Decisions**:
   - Used **gradient hero** with CTA buttons.
   - **Feature cards** with hover lift effect.
   - **Contact form** via [Formspree](https://formspree.io).
4. **Custom CSS**: Added smooth transitions, Inter font, and sticky navbar scroll effect.
5. **Responsiveness**: Tested on mobile, tablet, desktop using Chrome DevTools.
