## Project Overview

**Nexlify** is a modern, responsive, and professional web application built using **Bootstrap 5**. It consists of three fully functional pages:

- **Home Page** – Hero section, feature cards, sticky navbar, footer  
- **About Page** – Services showcase with alternating image-text layout  
- **Contact Page** – Clean, validated contact form with real email submission  

All components were **remixed from Bootstrap 5 Examples**, **not copied**, and enhanced with **custom CSS, animations, and UX polish**.

## Step-by-Step Development Process

| Step | Action |
|------|-------|
| 1 | Reviewed [Bootstrap 5 Examples](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/) |
| 2 | Identified reusable components: **Navbar, Cards, Forms, Grid, Hero** |
| 3 | Created file structure: `index.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`, `css/`, `js/` |
| 4 | Built **Home Page** with gradient hero, feature cards, and sticky navbar |
| 5 | Designed **About Page** using alternating grid layout with placeholder images |
| 6 | Built **Contact Page** with validated form using **Formspree.io** |
| 7 | Added **custom CSS** (`custom.css`) for colors, hover effects, and scroll behavior |
| 8 | Added **JavaScript** for navbar shrink on scroll |
| 9 | Tested responsiveness on mobile, tablet, and desktop |
| 10 | Deployed via **GitHub Pages** |

## Tools & Resources Used (Full Transparency)

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| **Bootstrap 5 CDN** | Core framework (no local install) |
| **Bootstrap Docs & Examples** | Reference for components |
| **Grok (xAI)** | AI assistance for code structure, debugging, and optimization |
| **Formspree.io** | Free form backend (no server needed) |
| **GitHub & GitHub Pages** | Version control and live deployment |
| **Chrome DevTools** | Responsive testing and debugging |

> **Note:** I used **Grok AI** to generate clean, modular code and ensure best practices. All final code was reviewed, modified, and understood by me.

## Challenges Faced & Solutions

| Challenge | How I Solved It |
|---------|-----------------|
| Navbar not shrinking on scroll | Added `fixed-top` + JavaScript `scroll` event to toggle `.scrolled` class |
| Contact form not submitting | Used **Formspree** – free, instant, no backend needed |
| Hero text overflow on mobile | Used `display-4` → `h1`, added `text-center`, and tested with DevTools |
| Inconsistent spacing | Used **Bootstrap spacing utilities** (`py-5`, `g-4`, `mb-4`) consistently |
| Card hover effect not smooth | Added `transition: transform 0.2s` in CSS |
